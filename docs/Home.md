# Learning-Based LPBF Thermal Design

Welcome to the **Learning-Based LPBF Thermal Design** wiki!

This project explores machine learning and differentiable physics for optimizing laser scan strategies in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF).

## Documentation

- **[Usage](usage.md)**: How to run experiments and use the codebase.
- **[Formulation](formulation.md)**: Mathematical formulation of the thermal model and optimization problem.
- **[Tracking Architecture](tracking.md)**: Details on the tracking and state management architecture.
- **[MLflow Backend](mlflow_backend.md)**: How experiments are tracked using MLflow.
- **[Diagnostics & Metrics](diagnostics_metrics.md)**: Explanation of the diagnostics and metrics used.
- **[Artifacts & Reports](artifacts_and_reports.md)**: Structure of generated artifacts and reports.

## Overview from README

*(See the main repository [README](https://github.com/technojesusB/learning-based-lpbf-thermal-design) for the most up-to-date project overview)*

### Motivation
LPBF is governed by complex, highly transient thermal processes. Scan strategies strongly influence peak temperatures and cooling rates. This project aims to optimize these strategies using ML.

### Scope and Assumptions
- 2D powder bed layer
- Transient heat conduction
- Synthetic data
- Focus on methodology
